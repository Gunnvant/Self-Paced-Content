Tesla is investigating bottlenecks in their production, and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query that determines which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions

Table parts_assembly contains all parts in production.
A part with no finish_date is an unfinished part.
parts_assembly Table

```shell
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer
```
**parts_assembly Example Input**

| part    | finish_date         | assembly_step |
| :------ | :------------------ | :------------ |
| battery | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| battery | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| battery | 03/22/2022 00:00:00 | 3             |
| bumper  | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| bumper  | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| bumper  |                     | 3             |
| bumper  |                     | 4             |

**Example Output**

```shell
part
bumper
```
**Explanation**

The only item in the output is "bumper" because step 3 didn't have a finish date.


Use the dataset [parts_assembly](./parts_assembly.csv)

**Solution**

```sql
with final_table as (
SELECT part,count(part) as cnt from parts_assembly 
where finish_date is null
group by part)
select part from final_table;
```
