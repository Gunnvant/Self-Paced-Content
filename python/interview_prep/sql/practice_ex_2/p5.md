Assume you are given the table below that shows job postings for all companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to get the number of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Clarification:

Duplicate job listings refer to two jobs at the same company with the same title and description.
job_listings Table:

```shell
Column Name	Type
job_id	integer
company_id	integer
title	string
description	string
```

**job_listings Example Input:**

| job_id | company_id | title            | description                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Example Output:**

```shell
co_w_duplicate_jobs
1
```

**Explanation**
Because job IDs 945 and 164 are at the same company (345), and the jobs have the same title and description, there is exactly one company with a duplicate job.

You can use the dataset [here](./job_listings.csv)

**Solution**
```sql
with final_table as (
SELECT company_id,title,description, count(*) as cnt
from job_listings
group by 1,2,3)
select count(*) as co_w_duplicate_jobs
from final_table
where cnt >1 ;
```
