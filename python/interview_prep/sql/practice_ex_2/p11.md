**subscriptions table**

|   column   | type |
|:----------:|:----:|
|   user_id  |  int |
| start_date | date |
|  end_date  | date |

Given a table of product subscriptions with a subscription start date and end date for each user, write a query that returns true or false whether or not each user has a subscription date range that overlaps with any other user.

**Example:**

| user_id | start_date |  end_date  |
|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|    1    | 2019-01-01 | 2019-01-31 |
|    2    | 2019-01-15 | 2019-01-17 |
|    3    | 2019-01-29 | 2019-02-04 |
|    4    | 2019-02-05 | 2019-02-10 |

**Output**

| user_id | overlap |
|:-------:|:-------:|
|    1    |   True  |
|    2    |   True  |
|    3    |   True  |
|    4    |  False  |

Use the following sql statement to create the table

```sql
create table subscriptions (
user_id int,
start_date date,
end_date date
)

insert into subscriptions values
(1,'2019-01-01','2019-01-31'),
(2,'2019-01-15','2019-01-17'),
(3,'2019-01-29','2019-02-04'),
(4,'2019-02-05','2019-02-10');

```

**Solution**
You can do self join on the table itself to solve this. Below is the code

```sql
with t3 as (
with t2 as (
with t1 as (
SELECT s1.user_id,s2.start_date
FROM subscriptions AS s1
LEFT JOIN subscriptions AS s2
    ON s1.user_id != s2.user_id
        AND s1.start_date <= s2.end_date
        AND s1.end_date >= s2.start_date)
select user_id,
case 
	when start_date is not null then 1 else 0
end as overlap
from t1)
select user_id,sum(overlap) as overlap
from t2
group by 1)
select user_id,
case when overlap>0 then "True" else "False" end as overlap
from t3;

```
