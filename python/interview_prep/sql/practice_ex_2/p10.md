Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.

Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.

Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.

**monthly_cards_issued Table:**

```shell
Column Name	Type
issue_month	integer
issue_year	integer
card_name	string
issued_amount	integer
```

**monthly_cards_issued Example Input:**

| issue_month | issue_year | card_name              | issued_amount |
| :---------- | :--------- | :--------------------- | :------------ |
| 1           | 2021       | Chase Sapphire Reserve | 170000        |
| 2           | 2021       | Chase Sapphire Reserve | 175000        |
| 3           | 2021       | Chase Sapphire Reserve | 180000        |
| 3           | 2021       | Chase Freedom Flex     | 65000         |
| 4           | 2021       | Chase Freedom Flex     | 70000         |

**Example Output:**

```shell
card_name	issued_amount
Chase Sapphire Reserve	170000
Chase Freedom Flex	65000
```

**Explanation**

Chase Sapphire Reserve card was launched on 1/2021 with an issued amount of 170,000 cards and the Chase Freedom Flex card was launched on 3/2021 with an issued amount of 65,000 cards.

You can use the data [monthly_cards_issued](./monthly_cards_issued.csv)


**Solution**

```sql
with final_table as (
SELECT *,
rank() over(PARTITION BY card_name order by issue_year,issue_month) as launch
FROM monthly_cards_issued)
select card_name,issued_amount from final_table
where launch = 1
order by issued_amount desc;

```
