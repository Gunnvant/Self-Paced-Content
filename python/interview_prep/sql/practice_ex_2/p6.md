Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022. Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.

**events Table:**

```shell
Column Name	Type
app_id	integer
event_type	string
timestamp	datetime
```

**events Example Input:**

| app_id | event_type | timestamp           |
| :----- | :--------- | :------------------ |
| 123    | impression | 07/18/2022 11:36:12 |
| 123    | impression | 07/18/2022 11:37:12 |
| 123    | click      | 07/18/2022 11:37:42 |
| 234    | impression | 07/18/2022 14:15:12 |
| 234    | click      | 07/18/2022 14:16:12 |

**Example Output:**

| app_id | ctr    |
| :----- | :----- |
| 123    | 50  |
| 234    | 100 |

Explanation

App 123 has a CTR of 50.00% because this app receives 1 click out of the 2 impressions. Hence, it's 1/2 = 50.00%.

Use the data [events](./events.csv)

**Solution**

```sql
with final_t as (
with inner_t as (
select *,
        case when event_type = 'click' then 1 else 0
        end as click_dummy,
        case when event_type = 'impression' then 1 else 0
        end as impression_dummy
from events
where timestamp>= '2022-01-01'
AND timestamp < '2023-01-01')
select app_id,sum(click_dummy)::float as clicks,
sum(impression_dummy)::float as impressions
from inner_t
group by 1)
select app_id, round((clicks/impressions)*100) as ctr
from final_t;
```
