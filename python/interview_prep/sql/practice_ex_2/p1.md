Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:

There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
candidates Table:

```shell
Column Name	Type
candidate_id	integer
skill	varchar
```

**candidates Example Input:**


| candidate_id | skill      |
| ------------ | --------- |
| 123          | Python     |
| 123          | Tableau    |
| 123          | PostgreSQL |
| 234          | R          |
| 234          | PowerBI    |
| 234          | SQL Server |
| 345          | Python     |
| 345          | Tableau    |


**Example Output**:

candidate_id
123

Explanation

Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.

Use the dataset [d1.csv](./d1.csv). Load it to your db of choice.

**Solution**

```sql
with final_table as (
SELECT CASE
         WHEN skill in ('Python','Tableau','PostgresSQL') then candidate_id
         ELSE -1
       END as candidate_id
FROM candidates)
select distinct(candidate_id) from final_table
where candidate_id!=-1
order by candidate_id;
```
