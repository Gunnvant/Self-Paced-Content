A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is a company which buys at least 1 product from each product category.

Write a query to report the company ID which is a Supercloud customer.

As of 5 Dec 2022, data in the customer_contracts and products tables were updated.

**customer_contracts Table:**

```shell
Column Name	Type
customer_id	integer
product_id	integer
amount	integer
```

**customer_contracts Example Input:**

| customer_id | product_id | amount |
| :---------- | :--------- | :----- |
| 1           | 1          | 1000   |
| 1           | 3          | 2000   |
| 1           | 5          | 1500   |
| 2           | 2          | 3000   |
| 2           | 6          | 2000   |
|             |            |        |

**products Table:**

```shell
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
product_category	string
product_name	string
```

**products Example Input:**

| product_id | product_category | product_name             |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :----------------------- |
| 1          | Analytics        | Azure Databricks         |
| 2          | Analytics        | Azure Stream Analytics   |
| 4          | Containers       | Azure Kubernetes Service |
| 5          | Containers       | Azure Service Fabric     |
| 6          | Compute          | Virtual Machines         |
| 7          | Compute          | Azure Functions          |

**Example Output:**

```shell
customer_id
1
```

**Explanation:**

Customer 1 bought from Analytics, Containers, and Compute categories of Azure, and thus is a Supercloud customer. Customer 2 isn't a Supercloud customer, since they don't buy any container services from Azure.

Use the data in the files [customer_contracts](./customer_contracts.csv) and [products](./products.csv)

**Solution**

```sql
with final_t as (
with d_t as (
with inter_t as (
SELECT * FROM customer_contracts
left join products 
on customer_contracts.product_id=products.product_id)
select *,
        case when product_category='Analytics' then 1 else 0
        end as ana_d,
        case when product_category='Containers' then 1 else 0
        end as con_d,
        case when product_category='Compute' then 1 else 0
        end as comp_d
from inter_t)
select customer_id, sum(ana_d) as num_analytics,
sum(con_d) as num_containers, sum(comp_d) as num_compute
from d_t
group by 1)
select customer_id from final_t
where num_analytics>0 and num_containers>0 and num_compute>0;
```
