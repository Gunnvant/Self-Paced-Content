Assume there are three Spotify tables containing information about the artists, songs, and music charts. Write a query to determine the top 5 artists whose songs appear in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table the highest number of times. From now on, we'll refer to this ranking number as "song appearances".

Output the top 5 artist names in ascending order along with their song appearances ranking (not the number of song appearances, but the rank of who has the most appearances). The order of the rank should take precedence.

For example, Ed Sheeran's songs appeared 5 times in Top 10 list of the global song rank table; this is the highest number of appearances, so he is ranked 1st. Bad Bunny's songs appeared in the list 4, so he comes in at a close 2nd.

**Assumptions:**

- If two artists' songs have the same number of appearances, the artists should have the same rank.
- The rank number should be continuous (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5) and not skipped (1, 2, 2, 4, 5).


**artists Table:**


| Column Name | Type    |
| :---------- | :------ |
| artist_id   | integer |
| artist_name | varchar |

**artists Example Input:**

| artist_id | artist_name |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| 101       | Ed Sheeran  |
| 120       | Drake       |

**songs Table:**

| Column Name | Type    |
| :---------- | :------ |
| song_id     | integer |
| artist_id   | integer |

**songs Example Input:**

| song_id | artist_id |
| :------ | :-------- |
| 45202   | 101       |
| 19960   | 120       |

**global_song_rank Table:**

| Column Name | Type                  |
| :---------- | :-------------------- |
| day         | integer (1-52)        |
| song_id     | integer               |
| rank        | integer (1-1,000,000) |

**global_song_rank Example Input:**

| day | song_id | rank |
| :-- | :------ | :--- |
| 1   | 45202   | 5    |
| 3   | 45202   | 2    |
| 1   | 19960   | 3    |
| 9   | 19960   | 15   |

**Example Output:**

| artist_name | artist_rank |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Ed Sheeran  | 1           |
| Drake       | 2           |

**Explanation**

Ed Sheeran's song appeared twice in the Top 10 list of global song rank while Drake's song is only listed once. Therefore, Ed is ranked #1 and Drake is ranked #2.

Use the datasets [artists](./artists.csv), [songs](./songs.csv), [global_rankings](./global_song_rank.csv)

**Solution**

```sql
with final_data as (
with num_data as (
with dummy_d as (
with inner_t as (
SELECT * FROM artists
left join songs 
on artists.artist_id = songs.artist_id
left join global_song_rank
on songs.song_id = global_song_rank.song_id)
select *, case when rank<=10 then 1 else 0 end as top_d
from inner_t)
select artist_name, sum(top_d) as num_times
from dummy_d
group by 1)
select *, dense_rank() over(order by num_times desc) as rank_artist
from num_data)
select artist_name,rank_artist
from final_data
where rank_artist<=5;
```
