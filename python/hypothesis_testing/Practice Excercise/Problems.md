**Q3.** Use the dataset `./Data/power_gen.csv`. This dataset contains information on the electrical power generated across time from `09/01/2017` to `12/22/2022` [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arvindnagaonkar/power-generation-data?select=PowerGeneration.csv). It has been the belief that the average daily power production is 19.1 MU. Given that we have now actual data, can we do a hypothesis test and verify our hypothesis?
