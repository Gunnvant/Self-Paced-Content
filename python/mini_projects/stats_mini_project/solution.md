You can refer to the [env.yaml](./env.yaml) to understand the package requirements to run the solution.

If you are running a `conda` distribution you can use the following commands to create a python environment.

```shell
conda env create -f env.yaml
```
The above command will create a conda environment named `stats_mini_project`.

After creating the environment, you can activate the environment by running the following commands

```shell
conda activate stats_mini_project
```
