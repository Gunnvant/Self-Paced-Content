**Q1** Use the dataset `./data/power_gen.csv`. This dataset contains information on the electrical power generated across time from `09/01/2017` to `12/22/2022` [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arvindnagaonkar/power-generation-data?select=PowerGeneration.csv). It has been the belief that in summer months (April-September) the power production is more than that in winter months (October-March). Given that we have now actual data, can we do a hypothesis test and verify our hypothesis?

**Q2** Use the dataset `./data/power_gen.csv`. This dataset contains information on the electrical power generated across time from `09/01/2017` to `12/22/2022` [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arvindnagaonkar/power-generation-data?select=PowerGeneration.csv). It has been the belief that year on year power production is increasing and is significantly different.(Consider data from 2018 to 2022)Given that we have now actual data, can we do a hypothesis test and verify our hypothesis?
