## Hypothesis Tests

Common tests:

1. T-test for small samples
2. 2 sample t test
3. ANOVA test one way and 2 way
4. Chi Square Test of Factor Association

## Day 1

**T-test for small samples**

Drill problems

1. A sports company claim that the average life of their product is 1500 hours. However a sample of size 10 is tested and life is reported as 1800 1200 1300 1500 1700 1500 1200 1500 1400 1300. Can we doubt companyâ€™s claim at 10% significance level?

- No
- Yes
- Cannot say, as p-value is on the margin
Not enough information is given

2. A survey claimed that on an average people are 10 kgs overweight in city A. A sample of 18 randomly selected individuals were taken to test the claim. Their average excess weight was found to be 12.7 kgs and the standard deviation was 3.3 kgs. Is there a reason to believe that the average weight has increased at the 5% significance level?

- No
- Yes
- Cannot say, as the p value is on the margin
- Not enough information is given

3. The average mortgage rates in a city A is 8.43 percent. However it is seen in the random sample of 11 banks that the mean rate is 8.61 with a standard deviation of 0.33 percent. At 2 percent significance level can we conclude that mortgage rates are more than 8.43%?
- Yes
- May be
- No
- None of the above

**One Tail and Two Tail Tests**
One can have hypothesis tests which have the following form of

**A**

- H0: Stat=a
- Ha: Stat!=a

**B**

- H0: Stat=a
- Ha: Stat>a or Stat<a

Usage depends on the context.

**Class/Drill problems**

Problem 1:

A company advertises that they sell milk in packaging of 1 liter. If you were to sample these milk cartons to understand how much milk is being sold in the cartons, will you do a one tail test or a two tail test.

Assume that you observed in a sample of 45 cartons an average volume of 1.1 liters with a standard deviation of 0.12 liters.

**Rejection rule for 2 tail test**

If p-value<siglevel/2 then reject else not.

Share other scenarios where you will prefer a 2 tail test over a one tail test.

**T test for 2 samples**
