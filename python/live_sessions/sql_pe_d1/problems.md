## P4 [link](https://datalemur.com/questions/tesla-unfinished-parts)
Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query that determines which parts with the assembly steps have initiated the assembly process but remain unfinished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

**parts_assembly Table**

| Column Name   | Type     |
| :------------ | :------- |
| part          | string   |
| finish_date   | datetime |
| assembly_step | integer  |

**parts_assembly Example Input**

| part    | finish_date         | assembly_step |
| :------ | :------------------ | :------------ |
| battery | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| battery | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| battery | 03/22/2022 00:00:00 | 3             |
| bumper  | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| bumper  | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| bumper  |                     | 3             |
| bumper  |                     | 4             |

**Example Output**

| part   | assembly_step |
| :----- | :------------ |
| bumper | 3             |
| bumper | 4             |

**Explanation**

The bumpers in step 3 and 4 are the only item that remains unfinished as it lacks a recorded finish date.

## P5 [link](https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-histogram-tweets)

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

**tweets Table:**

| Column Name | Type      |
| :---------- | :-------- |
| tweet_id    | integer   |
| user_id     | integer   |
| msg         | string    |
| tweet_date  | timestamp |

**tweets Example Input:**

| tweet_id | user_id | msg                                                               | tweet_date          |

| :----------- | :-------- |
| 1            | 2         |
| 2            | 1         |

**Explanation:**

Based on the example output, there are two users who posted only one tweet in 2022, and one user who posted two tweets in 2022. The query groups the users by the number of tweets they posted and displays the number of users in each group.
